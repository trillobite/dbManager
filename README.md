# dbManager
Just a simple mini db tool written with jsonHTML and micronDB, can be used as an example of how jsonHTML and micronDB can produce robust client side javaScript web applications. This project is actually being used to manage inventory of product stock by an ebay seller that I know personally. The project took two hours to complete initially, and is currently being updated to polish up the interface.

Select openDB and select sampleDB which is included in this project. Type 4433 in the first textbox field (model number), clear the second text box (brand), and hit search. You can then enter a value in the textbox for brand, and hit save to generate a new entry. You can then click saveDB, if you wish to export a raw db file to load in at any time in the future.

Requires jQuery, and jsonHTML (included).

dbManager.js located within the scripts folder is what you want for your project.
